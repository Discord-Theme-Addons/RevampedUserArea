# Compact Userarea
A compact, better looking, user area. This addon looks best with Gibbu's [Radial Status](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/RadialStatus).

# Placement Issues
Before making an issue on this repo about something being positioned incorrectly, please make sure you check any themes / plugins / quick css that you have enabled for conflicting css. Some things you should look out for:
- Anything that messes with the userarea.
- Anything that messes with the guildlist.

Below are some known plugins / themes that can cause the issues with this addon.
- **[Sidebar Zoom](https://github.com/HooferDevelops/sidebar-zoom)** will cause the top-left to be blank (not too sure if this happens anymore as of 11/25/2021).
- **[Harmony Discord](https://github.com/KraXen72/harmony-discord)** just flatout breaks everything.
- **[Frosted Glass](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/FrostedGlass)** may cause some things to be positioned incorrectly, pretty much making it unuseable.
- **[Spotify Discrd](https://github.com/CapnKitten/Spotify-Discord)** will have slight displacement with the avatar, status picker items will be messed up, and the bar at the bottom will be a bit broken because the userarea is moved.
