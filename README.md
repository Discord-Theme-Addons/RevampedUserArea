# Conflicting Issues
Before you make an issue on this repo about something being positioned incorrectly, please make sure you check any themes / quick css / plugins that you have enabled for conflicting CSS. You should look out for anything that messes with either the user area or guild list. In most cases, I am unable to add support for stuff that conflicts with it. It is up to you to modify it to work best in your case.

Below are some known themes / plugins that will cause conflict with this theme addon.
- [Sidebar Zoom](https://github.com/HooferDevelops/sidebar-zoom) will cause the top-left to be blank (not too sure if this happens anymore as of 11/25/2021).
- [Harmony Discord](https://github.com/KraXen72/harmony-discord) just flatout breaks everything.
- [Frosted Glass](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/FrostedGlass) may cause some things to be positioned incorrectly, pretty much making it unuseable.
- [Spotify Discrd](https://github.com/CapnKitten/Spotify-Discord) will have slight displacement with the avatar, status picker items will be messed up, and the bar at the bottom will be a bit broken because the userarea is moved.
- [Horizontal Sever List](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) will interfere with the buttons and overlap with the server list, making it difficult to press some things.
- [Lavender](https://github.com/Lavender-Discord/Lavender) will make the userarea entirely disappear.
