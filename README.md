# Positioning Issues
If you are running into an issue with the user area in a weird position, please make sure you check for any conflicting CSS (i.e. themes, quickcss, plugins). In most cases, it is up to you to fix it to work best in your case since I am unable to add support for it.

Below are some known themes / plugins that can cause issues with this addon.
- [Sidebar Zoom](https://github.com/HooferDevelops/sidebar-zoom) (unsure as of 11/25/2021).
