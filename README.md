A compact, better looking user area.

# Installation
For installation, go to **Themes -> Open CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash**, and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/RevampedUserArea
```

# Other Support Installation
If you're using Bottom Bar (another theme made by me), this is most likely going to break. I've made a separate version for it, so if you're using it, you should install this version instead by going into **Themes -> Open CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** and entering the following:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch BottomBar https://github.com/LuckFire/RevampedUserArea
```
