# Installation & Updating
For installation, go to **Themes -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/RevampedUserArea
```

Since Powercord's updater is currently broken, you have to update the theme manually. In order to do this, go to **Themes -> RevampedUserArea -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git pull
```

# Issues
Here is a list of plugins/themes/css that can cause issues with this addon. If you're still having issues, you can either make an issue request, ping me in the Powercord server, or DM me on Discord.

- If the top left is blank, it's most likely because you have Hoofer's Sidebar Zoom (https://github.com/HooferDevelops/sidebar-zoom)
- Harmony Discord breaks everything with it (https://github.com/KraXen72/harmony-discord). 
- If the status picker icons are enlarged and misplaced, it's most likely because you have Compact status Menu.
- If you don't have the top bar for Dicsord, it will be positioned incorrectly.
- Anything else that messes with the status picker/action buttons/avatar.

Make sure you check all of the above before messaging me or making a PR on this repo.
