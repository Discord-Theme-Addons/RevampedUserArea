Recently I have recoded this to use SCSS, mainly for maintainability ~~(and the sake of my sanity).~~ Some other changes are:
- Bottom Bar support is basically gone (or well I won't be maintaining the branch anymore) because I'm too lazy to.
- Fixed where you couldn't quick clear your status.
- Readded back where the name tag would show next to the action buttions. NOTE: You will no longer be able to copy your username.
- Some position adjustmets + cleaner code.
